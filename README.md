>The Abstract Toolkit â€“ a widget toolkit for GUI and text-mode applications. It allows you to write an UI and, depending on the OS having or not a desktop environment, it runs on GUI (GTK) or text-mode (Curses).

>(Lua version of <https://github.com/gobolinux/AbsTK>)

Documentation available at <https://pedroalvesv.github.io/AbsTK-Lua>.

## Installation

AbsTK can generate GUI and text-mode applications, with those being GTK and Ncurses. So, it's correct to presume that both are 
required to run the toolkit.
The good news is that it isn't hard to install them:

```
$ [sudo] luarocks install lgi
$ [sudo] luarocks install lcurses
```

And to finally install AbsTK:

```
$ [sudo] luarocks install --server=http://luarocks.org/dev abstk
```

## Getting Started

### Routines

AbsTK routines are simple.

#### Single Screen

1. Create a Screen
2. Populate Screen with widgets
3. Run Screen

As you can see [here](https://github.com/PedroAlvesV/AbsTK-Lua/blob/master/src/minimalist-test/minimalist-test.lua).

#### Wizard

1. Create Wizard
2. Create Screens
3. Populate Screens with widgets
4. Add Screens to Wizard
5. Run Wizard

As you can see [here](https://github.com/PedroAlvesV/AbsTK-Lua/blob/master/src/complete-test/wizard.lua).

### First steps

There are two must call functions that AbsTK needs in order to start:

```lua
local abstk = require 'abstk'
abstk.set_mode(...)
```

While the first one is pretty obvious, the second one is just as necessary as it. To determine whether UI is going to be constructed, AbsTK uses a function that asks for a string parameter. When nothing is passed, the toolkit decides which one to use based on `os.getenv("DISPLAY")` returning value. If it returns something, the OS runs in a GUI, so AbsTK runs in GUI as well. Otherwise, it runs in text-mode.

### Widgets

#### Screen

To add widgets to a Screen, all that must be done is call its construction method with the desired Screen object.
About the functions names, they are very clear and follow a golden rule:
>"add" refers to single widgets construction;

>"create" refers to groups of widgets construction.

For instance,

```lua
scr:add_button('button', "I'm a Button!")
scr:create_button_box('bbox', {"We", "Are", "A", "Button", "Group."})
```

#### Wizard

As Screens for widgets, Wizards follow the same pattern:

```lua
wizard:add_page('screen', scr)
```

You can see more examples in [src/complete-test/](src/complete-test/) and a list with every function at the [documentation](<https://pedroalvesv.github.io/AbsTK-Lua>).
